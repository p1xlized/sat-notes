### Why binary is not enough?
We can count positive with binary, but it's not possible to store negative values
Two's complement notation
### Two's complement notation
Two’s complement is the standard way to represent **signed integers** in binary, allowing positive and negative values efficiently.
##### Key Facts
- **MSB (Most Significant Bit)** = Sign bit (sbits- signed bit)
		`0` → Positive, `1` → Negative  
- **Positive numbers** remain the same as unsigned binary.  
- **Negative numbers**: Invert bits & add **1**.  
- Arithmetic works naturally (addition/subtraction).  
- **Range (n-bit):**  
  - Min: $-2^{(n-1)}$
  - Max: $2^{(n-1)} - 1$
##### Example (4-bit Two’s Complement)

| Decimal | Two’s Complement |
|---------|-----------------|
|  3      | `0011`          |
|  2      | `0010`          |
|  1      | `0001`          |
|  0      | `0000`          |
| -1      | `1111`          |
| -2      | `1110`          |
| -3      | `1101`          |
##### Change bit sign
To get the **Two’s Complement** of a number (to negate it), you:
1. **Flip the bits** (invert 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
2. **Add 1** to the result.
This works both ways:
- **Positive to Negative**
- **Negative to Positive** (undoing the two’s complement)
$6 = 0110_2$
$0110 \Rightarrow 1001$
$1001 + 1 = 1010_2$ 
**Result:** $-6 = 1010_2$
###### This way, you can perform both addition and subtraction.

| Problem in base 10 | Problem in two's complement | Answer in base 10 |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 3 + 2            | 0011 + 0010                | 5                  |
| -3 + (-2)        | 1101 + 1110                | -5                 |
| 7 + (-5)         | 0111 + 1011                | 2                  |
### Overflow in Two’s Complement

Overflow occurs in **two’s complement** when the result of an addition or subtraction **exceeds the representable range** of bits.

#### How Overflow Happens

- **Adding two positive numbers gives a negative result**
- **Adding two negative numbers gives a positive result**

This happens because the leftmost bit (sign bit) changes incorrectly.

#### Example (4-bit numbers)
 **Overflow (Positive Overflow)**
Expected:  
$6+3=96 + 3 = 96+3=9$
Binary Calculation:  
$01102+00112=100120110_2 + 0011_2 = 1001_201102​+00112​=10012$​
**1001** in 4-bit two’s complement = -7 <span style="background:#ff4d4f">(Incorrect!)</span>

**Overflow (Negative Overflow)**
Expected:  
$−6+(−3)=−9-6 + (-3) = -9−6+(−3)=−9$
Binary Calculation:  
$10102+11012=011121010_2 + 1101_2 = 0111_210102​+11012​=01112​$
**0111** in 4-bit two’s complement = 7 <span style="background:#ff4d4f">(Incorrect!)</span>
