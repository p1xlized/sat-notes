### Data Corruption and Error Detection

Transferred data can be **corrupted** due to various factors, such as **dirt or grease on magnetic surfaces, malfunctioning circuits, corrupted transmission paths, or background radiation**. These errors affect the reliability of computing systems. 

To improve **data integrity**, encoding techniques are used to **detect and correct errors**, ensuring more reliable data transmission and storage.
### Parity Bit
A **parity bit** is a simple error detection method used in data transmission. It adds an extra bit to ensure the number of **1s** in the data follows a specific rule: 
- **Even parity**: The total number of 1s (including the parity bit) is even. 
- **Odd parity**: The total number of 1s is odd.

### Check Bytes for Error Detection
A **check byte** is an error detection method where an extra byte is added to data, containing information that helps verify integrity during transmission or storage.
##### How It Works
- A check byte is computed using a function like **checksum** or **XOR** over the data bytes.
- The receiver recalculates the check byte and compares it with the transmitted one.
- If they don't match, an error is detected.
# Hamming Distance and Error Detection

**Hamming distance** is the number of bit positions that differ between two binary strings. It measures how different two binary values are and is used in **error detection and correction**.
### Formula
For two binary numbers **A** and **B**, the Hamming distance is the count of different bits.
###### **Example**
**Decoding the pattern** `010100`
