### What is Data Compression & Why do we use?
To reduce the amount of data in storage or transfer the data is compressed while retaining the same information
### Lossy vs Lossless
- Lossless keeps all of the information
- Lossy looses some (unnecessary?) information and provides more compression (audio & video)
### Run-lenght encoding
Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compresses data by replacing repeated values with a single value and a count. It works well for long identical sequences but not for varied data.
**Example**:$11111111$ vs $10$ $1's$
### Frequency-dependent encoding
**Frequency-dependent encoding** assigns shorter codes to frequent symbols and longer ones to rare symbols, reducing data size. **Huffman coding** builds an optimal prefix-free binary tree based on symbol frequencies.
###### Example:
Given the text **"ABACA"**, with these frequencies:
- **A**: 3 times
- **B**: 1 time
- **C**: 1 time
Huffman assigns shorter codes to frequent letters:
- **A → 0**
- **B → 10**
- **C → 11**
Encoded output: **0 10 0 11 0** (5 bits vs. 8-bit ASCII, which would need 40 bits).
### Relative encoding
**Relative encoding** stores only the difference between consecutive values instead of absolute values, reducing redundancy. It is useful in sequential data like images or sensor readings.
Instead of storing full values, only the first value and changes are kept, reducing storage needs.
###### Example:
Original data:  
$100, 105, 110, 120, 125$
Encoded as differences:  
$100, +5, +5, +10, +5$
