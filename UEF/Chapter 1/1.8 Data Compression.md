### What is Data Compression & Why do we use?
To reduce the amount of data in storage or transfer the data is compressed while retaining the same information
### Lossy vs Lossless
- Lossless keeps all of the information
- Lossy looses some (unnecessary?) information and provides more compression (audio & video)
### Run-lenght encoding
Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compresses data by replacing repeated values with a single value and a count. It works well for long identical sequences but not for varied data.
**Example**:$11111111$ vs $10$ $1's$
### Frequency-dependent encoding
**Frequency-dependent encoding** assigns shorter codes to frequent symbols and longer ones to rare symbols, reducing data size. **Huffman coding** builds an optimal prefix-free binary tree based on symbol frequencies.
###### Example:
Given the text **"ABACA"**, with these frequencies:
- **A**: 3 times
- **B**: 1 time
- **C**: 1 time
Huffman assigns shorter codes to frequent letters:
- **A → 0**
- **B → 10**
- **C → 11**
Encoded output: **0 10 0 11 0** (5 bits vs. 8-bit ASCII, which would need 40 bits).
### Relative encoding
**Relative encoding** stores only the difference between consecutive values instead of absolute values, reducing redundancy. It is useful in sequential data like images or sensor readings.
Instead of storing full values, only the first value and changes are kept, reducing storage needs.
###### Example:
Original data:  
$100, 105, 110, 120, 125$
Encoded as differences:  
$100, +5, +5, +10, +5$
### Dictionary Encoding
Dictionary encoding reduces data size by storing repeated patterns in a dictionary and referencing them instead of storing full data. This can be **lossless** (exact reconstruction) or **lossy** (some data loss for efficiency).

##### Example:
**Input:**
apple banana apple orange banana apple
**We assign a unique number to each word:**
`{1: apple, 2: banana, 3: orange}`
**Instead of storing full words, we use the dictionary:**
`1 2 1 3 2 1`
### LZW Compression Example
Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is a **lossless** dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated patterns with shorter codes. It dynamically builds a dictionary while processing the input.
### Compressing Images
Images compressed using bit map need a lot of space, thus they are usually compressed
##### GIF Compression
- **Reduces the number of colors** to optimize storage.
- Uses a **256-color palette** where **RGB combinations** are stored in a dictionary (color table).
- Each pixel is stored in **one byte** as a reference to the palette.
- **Lossy system** (some color details are lost).
- **Best suited for cartoons, simple graphics, and animations.**
##### JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
- **Compresses images by reducing details** that the human eye is less sensitive to.
- Uses **lossy compression**, discarding some image data to reduce file size.
- Supports **millions of colors** (24-bit depth).
- Best for **photographs and complex images** where slight quality loss is acceptable.
- **Not ideal for text, sharp edges, or repeated patterns** (artifacts may appear).
##### TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
- Supports **both lossless and lossy compression**.
- Stores images with **high quality** and **multiple layers**.
- Can handle **millions of colors** with **high bit-depth (up to 48-bit)**.
- **Used in professional photography, printing, and archiving**.
- **Larger file size** compared to JPEG and GIF.

### Compressing Videos/Audio
##### MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)
- **Used for video compression** (e.g., MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4).
- Reduces file size by **removing redundant frames** and compressing motion.
- Uses **lossy compression**, discarding unnoticeable details.
- Efficient for **streaming and storing videos**.
- **MPEG-4 (MP4)** is widely used for online videos.
##### MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3)
- **Compresses audio by removing inaudible frequencies**.
- Uses **lossy compression**, reducing file size while keeping sound quality acceptable.
- Bitrate affects quality: **higher bitrate = better sound** (e.g., 320kbps is better than 128kbps).
- **Widely used for music streaming and storage**.
- **Efficient for portable devices** with limited storage.
