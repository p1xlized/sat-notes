### Bit Patterns
Many kinds of information can be encoded as [[UEF/Chapter 1/1.1 Bits & Their Storage.md|bit]] patterns
Systems for encoding information has been establishes for:
1. Text
2. Numeric Data
3. Images
4. Sound
5. Other data
### Encoding Text(Strings)

**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a 7-bit character encoding standard used for basic text representation in computers.

**ISO 8859** is an 8-bit extension of ASCII, developed to support additional characters for various languages, making it more versatile for international text encoding.

**Unicode** is a universal character encoding standard that supports **all writing systems** worldwide. It extends **ASCII and ISO 8859**, using variable-length encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) to represent millions of characters, including symbols, emojis, and non-Latin scripts.
> [!NOTE]
    > A file consisting of ASCII/ Unicode coded symbols is called a text file.
    > - It can be manipulated with text editors(Notepad, Vim, etc.)
    > - Word Processor files(.docx) are <font color="#d83931">NOT</font> text files

**"Hello"** encoded using ASCII or UTF-8

### Encoding Numeric values
Numeric values in computers are encoded as **binary** (0s and 1s). Different encoding methods exist depending on the type of number:

- **Unsigned Integers** – Stored as raw binary (e.g., 8-bit can represent 0 to 255).
- **Signed Integers** – Use **Two’s Complement** to represent negative numbers.
- **Floating-Point Numbers** – Use the **IEEE 754** standard, encoding a number with a sign bit, exponent, and fraction (mantissa).
- **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal)** – Each decimal digit is stored as a separate 4-bit binary value.
### Encoding Images
##### Bitmap:
Digital images are represented by **pixels**, with colors defined using the **RGB model** (Red, Green, Blue). They can also be described using **luminance (brightness) and chrominance (color information)**. 
**Pros:**
- High detail and color accuracy
- Easily editable and shareable
- Can be compressed for storage

**Cons:**
- Loses quality when zoomed in (pixelation)
- Large file sizes for high-resolution images
- Compression can reduce quality
**File extensions:** jpg, png, etc.
##### Vector:
Vector images use **mathematical equations** to define shapes, lines, and colors instead of pixels. They are resolution-independent, meaning they can be scaled infinitely without losing quality.
**Pros:**
- Scalable without quality loss
- Smaller file sizes for simple graphics
- Ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations
**Cons:**
- Not suitable for detailed, photorealistic images
- Limited support for complex color gradients
- Requires specialized software to edit

### **Representing Sound**
##### Sample Rate
Sound is encoded by sampling its **amplitude** at regular intervals. Higher sampling rates capture more detail. **Telephone audio** uses **8,000 samples/sec**, while **CD quality** is **44,100 samples/sec**. High-fidelity recordings use **16-bit data per channel** for better accuracy.

##### MIDI
MIDI is a **digital representation of music** that stores **instructions** (notes, pitch, duration, and instrument data) instead of actual sound. It is widely used for composing, editing, and playback in digital music production.
