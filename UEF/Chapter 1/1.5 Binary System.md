### Number System:

A **number system** is a mathematical framework for representing and organizing numbers using a specific base, such as **binary (2), decimal (10), hexadecimal (16),** or **octal (8)**.
**Example:** $\large 375 = (3*100)+(7*10)+(5*1)\implies (3*10^{2)+}(3*10^1)+(5*10^0)$

### Binary System
While traditional decimal system is based on powers of <font color="#548dd4">TEN</font>, the binary system is based on powers of <font color="#d83931">TWO</font>
**Example:** $\large 1011 = (1*2^3)+(0*2^2)+(1*2^1)+(1*2^{0)=}8+0+2+1=11$(in decimal)
