### What are bits
At the lowest level of computers the data is stored by bits
**Example**:Binary data (0 or 1)
> [!ERROR]
    > bit != byte

---
### Boolean
**Boolean** => The bits are interpreted as: <span style="background:#affad1">true/false</span> | <span style="background:#affad1">0/1</span>
### Boolean Operation
An operation that manipulates one or more <span style="background:#affad1">true/false</span>
- **George Boole:** 1815-1864
###### Specific Operations:
- AND
- OR
- XOR(exclusive or)
- NOT

### AND, OR, XOR
They combines 2 inputs and creates an output

### NOT
It uses 1 input and gives 1 output
It's does the reversed.
**Example**: NOT(Finland is a Country) == Finland is not a country

### Gates 
**Gates or Logic gates:** are devices that computes Boolean operations.
- Implemented as small electronic circuits called transistors.
- 0/1 represented as voltage levels
- Building blocks of computers

### Flip-flops
Circuit gate that stores data as long there is power it will remember the value.

### Hexadecimal Notation
Computers deals with patterns of bits, which can be long & hard to understand for humans.
**Example**:10110010010001111001
Since machines use bit patterns that have lengths in multiple of four(8,16,32,64,128,256) we use Hexadecumal:
1011 0101 => <font color="#d83931">0x</font>B5(<font color="#d83931">0x</font> meaning it's in hexadecimal and B5 = 181)
