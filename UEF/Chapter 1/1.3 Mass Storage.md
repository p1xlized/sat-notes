Computers need more memory that is not-[[UEF/Chapter 1/1.2 Main Memory.md|volatile]]
To store mass data we use storage devices

|Name|Type|amount|
|----|----|----|
|Magnetic disks(HDD)|mechanical|16GB - 15tb|
|CDs(optical)|mechanical|600-700mb|
|DVD(optical)|mechanical|4-5 GB|
|Magnetic Tapes|mechanical||
|Flash Drives(USB)|electronic|8gb-1tb|
|Solid state drices(SSD)|electronic|120gb - 30tb|
### Why we use it
- Less volatility
- Larger storage capacity
- Low cost
- In many cases can be removed
### Mass Storage Performance
**Bandwidth:** total amount of [[UEF/Chapter 1/1.1 Bits & Their Storage.md|bit]] that can be transferred in a unit of time(ex: 3 megabits/second)
**Latency:** time between request and arrival of data

### Mechanical Storage  
Mechanical storage uses moving parts to read/write data, like **HDDs**, which have spinning platters and magnetic heads. They are slower and more failure-prone than solid-state drives.  

### Example: CD (Compact Disc)  
A **CD** is an optical disc that stores data using pits and lands read by a laser, unlike magnetic storage.

### Flash memory
Flash memory uses circuits to trap electrons in silicon dioxide chambers, allowing fast, small-unit data access without mechanical parts. It doesnâ€™t require refreshing, but data is erased in large blocks, and repeated erasing gradually wears out the storage medium.

### SSD
- Large flash memory devices
- Replaces HDD
**Advantages:**
- Fast read/write speeds
- No moving parts (more durable)
- Lower power consumption
- Silent operation
**Disadvantages:**
- More expensive per GB
- Limited write cycles (wears out over time)
